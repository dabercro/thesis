\chapter{Detector Projects} \label{app:project}

Each collaborator must contribute to the operation of the CMS detector before his or her name is added to the author list.
The operation of the detector is distinct from analyzing the data generated by the detector, so all collaborators must adopt some role outside of being a physicist.

This appendix details projects I completed in order to contribute to the operation of the CMS detector.
The first project presented is the Dynamo Consistency project.
It is a plugin for the dynamic data management system Dynamo \cite{iiyama2020dynamo} that compares the inventory of files Dynamo expects at a site with the files that are actually at a site.
The other project described is known as Workflow Web Tools.
This is a dynamic web server that displays errors reported by the CMS computing infrastructure to operators, and allows those operators to perform corrective actions through the web page.
Workflow Web Tools also tracks operator actions for future use in training various machine learning models.
Both projects produced software packages written in Python \cite{van1995python, 10.5555/1593511} and available through the Python Package Index (PyPI) as \texttt{dynamo-consistency} and \texttt{workflowwebtools}.
