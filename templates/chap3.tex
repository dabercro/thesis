\section{Associated Production at the LHC}

The LHC is a hadron collider.

Quark interactions can lead to Vector boson production,
since the protons are at high energy.

Virtual vector bosons can radiate a Higgs.

This happens along with additional event stuff,
caused by breaking apart the protons and pileup.

\section{Observables of Associated Production}

We can count charged leptons or infer neutrinos to tag vector bosons.

We are interested in Higgs to \bb.

\section{Detector Requirements}

We need to identify interesting particles,
be able to reconstruct missing transverse momentum,
and remove pileup.
