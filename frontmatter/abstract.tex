The differential cross section of $V\!H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ is measured with the CMS Detector.
The Simplified Template Cross Section framework is used.
The inclusive strength of the measured signal relative to the Standard Model is
$0.568^{+0.154}_{-0.147} \mathrm{(stat)}^{+0.134}_{-0.133} \mathrm{(sys)}$,
which agrees with the Standard Model within 2.1 standard deviations.
The measured spectrum of the recoiling vector boson transverse momentum
has a $p$-value of 9.3\%, assuming Standard Model predictions at the measured signal strength.
