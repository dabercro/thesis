\chapter{Conclusions} \label{ch:conclusion}

Good agreement between the STXS measurement and Standard Model predictions is observed.
However, study of the Higgs boson, and even study of $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ in
associated production, is not finished.
This analysis is only one of many to characterize the Higgs boson,
and this cross section measurement itself will be improved as more data is gathered
and measurement techniques are refined.

The first published searches of the Higgs in associated production by CMS
were given in 2011 \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-11-012},
As mentioned in the beginning of this document, the search concluded successfully in 2018.
After this discovery, confirmed also by ATLAS,
a joint effort produced the STXS framework for additional study of the
Higgs boson \cite{berger2019simplified}.
This is the stage the presented analysis comes in.
ATLAS has already published results of an STXS measurement using
Run 2 LHC data \cite{Aaboud_2019},
and this work will allow a direct comparison between the two experiments.
Standard Model confirmation of this independent experiment also immediately serves to
reduce any uncertanties from previous analyses.
Though the binning and results of this analysis may appear rudimentary
in the context of what is required to dispute the Standard Model,
the development of the techniques is crucial for studies to come.

While it is impossible to predict the future precisely,
international effort is working on two projects to continue to study the Higgs.
The LHC is receiving an upgrade, in what is called the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).
All cutting-edge technologies will be used to create a machine that will gather
an order of magnitude more data suitable for Higgs studies and
other searches beyond the Standard Model \cite{osti_1365580}.
Beyond that, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is currently being designed
for use as a Higgs factory for precision studies \cite{thecepcstudygroup2018cepc}.
These experiments will produce very fine-grained descriptions of
the Higgs differential cross section, and have the potential to uncover
discrepancies from the Standard Model.
They may allow us to understand just a little bit more about our universe,
along with any other exciting results from physics experiments looking elsewhere.
