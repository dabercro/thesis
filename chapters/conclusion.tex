\chapter{Conclusions} \label{ch:conclusion}

As a result of the STXS measurement,
an inclusive cross section is measured that is 2.1 standard deviations below the Standard Model.
The spectrum measured by the accompanying differential cross section
has a $p$-value of 9.3\%.
These measurements do not contradict the Standard Model.
However, study of the Higgs boson, and even study of $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ in
associated production, is not finished.
This analysis is only one of many to characterize the Higgs boson,
and this cross section measurement itself will be improved as more data is gathered
and measurement techniques are refined.

The first published searches of the Higgs in associated production by CMS
were given in 2011 \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-11-012},
As mentioned in the beginning of this document, the search concluded successfully in 2018
After the discovery, confirmed also by ATLAS,
a joint effort produced the STXS framework for additional study of the
Higgs boson \cite{berger2019simplified}.

ATLAS published a first STXS measurement using only the first two years of the LHC's Run 2 data \cite{Aaboud_2019}.
This publication, as well as the first publication with all three years of Run 2 data \cite{Aad:2727500}
only look at the two higest $p_T(V)$ bins of $250 < p_T(V) < \SI{400}{GeV}$ and $\SI{400}{GeV} < p_T(V)$
for $W\!H$ and $Z\!H$.

Standard Model confirmation of this independent experiment also immediately serves to
reduce any uncertainties from previous analyses. \phil{Can you rewrite
  this sentence, I find it very confusing}
Though the binning and results of this analysis may appear rudimentary
in the context of what is required to dispute the Standard Model,
the development of the techniques is crucial for studies to
come. 

While it is impossible to predict the future precisely,
there are multiple large projects underway with designs to continue to study the Higgs.
The LHC is receiving an upgrade, in what is called the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).
All cutting-edge technologies will be used to create a machine that will gather
an order of magnitude more data suitable for Higgs studies and
other searches beyond the Standard Model \cite{osti_1365580}.
Beyond that, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is currently being designed
for use as a Higgs factory for precision studies
\cite{thecepcstudygroup2018cepc}. \phil{why pick this one, should you
  not mention FCC?}
These experiments will produce very fine-grained descriptions of
the Higgs differential cross section, and have the potential to uncover
discrepancies from the Standard Model.
They may allow us to understand just a little bit more about our universe,
along with any other exciting results from physics experiments looking elsewhere.

\phil{Can you rewrite the last paragraph. The words are a little
  jumbled, but the message is nice. It would be good to end your
  thesis on a high note!}
