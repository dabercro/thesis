\section{Run 2 Data Collection}

The CMS detector collected proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{TeV}$
over three years during Run 2 of the LHC.
In 2016, CMS collected \SI{37.80}{fb^{-1}} of data \cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-17-001}.
In 2017, \SI{44.98}{fb^{-1}} of data was collected \cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-17-004}.
In 2018, CMS collected \SI{63.67}{fb^{-1}} of collision data \cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-18-002}.




\section{Multivariate Discriminator}

In each STXS bin, a multivariate discriminator is plotted which separates
the signal events from background events.
A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is trained for the resolved selection,
and a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) is trained for the boosted selection.
Using fewer discriminating variables in the boosted events
leads to this difference in architecture.

\subsection{Resolved DNN}

The DNN classifier for distinguishing background and signal events is prepared using
Keras with a Tensorflow backend using an Adam optimizer.
It has five hidden layers.
The number of nodes in each layer, from input to output, is 512, 256, 128, 64, 64, and 64.
The final layer is a softmax layer with the target of predicting the probability
of each event belonging to a particular class.

Each channel of 0-, 1-, and 2-leptons is trained separately,
and has slightly different input variables.
The list of input variables is given in Table~\ref{tab:dnn-inputs}.
All variables that are affected by the kinematic fit in the 2-lepton region
use the values calculated by the fit.

\subsection{Boosted BDT}

The BDT used to classify signal and background events in the boosted region
was trained using ROOT.
The model uses 100 trees with 20 cuts and a minimum node size of 0.05.
The QCD multi-jet backgrounds were not used in the training since the sample's large weights
of individual events affected the training.

The list of input variables for the BDT is the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Soft-drop mass of the reconstructed fat jet
\item Transverse momentum of the fat jet
\item Transverse momentum of the reconstructed vector boson
\item Number of soft-track jets with $p_T > \SI{5}{GeV}$
\item Double $b$-tagger output node for boosted jets
\end{itemize}
All of these variables were all used in the 0-, 1-, and 2-lepton regions,
even though the regions were trained separately.

\section{Combination Fit}

A simultaneous fit is run over all channels, control regions, and the signal selection region
in order to determine the most likely values for all
parameters with systematic uncertainties, called nuisance parameters,
as well as the most likely scale factors for all the MC backgrounds and signal.
The fit is done by using the \texttt{combine} tool \cite{cmsdocumentation} as part of
\texttt{CMSSW\_10\_2\_13} \cite{cmssw_doxygen}.
It is commonly used in searches of new physics processes within the CMS collaboration.
Part of the method for discovery involves finding the most likely values
for all nuisance parameters and signal strength simultaneously.
This maximum likelihood feature is used for the measurement of signal strength in
the STXS bins.

In addition to the most likely nuisance parameter and scale factor values,
the output of \texttt{combine} includes likelihood values at
multiple signal strengths with and without variation of
nuisance parameters from their most likely values.
This allows separation of systematic and statistical uncertainties from the global fit.
The \texttt{combine} tool also evaluated the impacts of each individual
nuisance parameter on the likelihood by varying them individually.
