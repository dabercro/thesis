\chapter{Analysis Results} \label{ch:results}

\section{Run 2 Data Collection}

The CMS detector collected proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{TeV}$
over three years during Run 2 of the LHC.
In 2016, CMS collected \SI{35.9}{fb^{-1}} of data \cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-17-001}.
In 2017, data corresponding to \SI{41.5}{fb^{-1}} were collected \cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-17-004}.
In 2018, CMS collected \SI{60}{fb^{-1}} of collision data \cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-18-002}.
This data, totaling about \SI{137}{fb^{-1}} was used for the analysis.

\section{Control Region Plots}

A number of variables are compared in all of the control regions
to ensure that the data and simulation are in reasonable agreement.
A selection of these plots are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:2016_Zll_vpt} through \ref{fig:2018_Zmm_vpt}.
%,fig:2016_Wln_j0pt,fig:2017_Znn_j0csv,fig:2017_Zee_j1pt,fig:2018_Wln_j1csv,
These are the distributions before fitting the control and signal regions to data,
so agreements improve after the fit.
The number of variables, selections, and separation of the data collection years
means that this is just a fraction of the total number of plots produced.
However, this subset shown demonstrate several discrepancies that needed to be accounted for in our systematics,
such as the $p_T(V)$ trend and normalization of certain background samples.

\section{Multivariate Discriminator}

In each STXS bin, a multivariate discriminator is plotted which separates
the signal events from background events.
A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is trained for the resolved selection,
and a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) is trained for the boosted selection.

\subsection{Resolved DNN}

The DNN classifier for distinguishing background and signal events is prepared using
Keras with a Tensorflow back-end using an Adam optimizer.
It has five hidden layers.
The number of nodes in each layer, from input to output, is 512, 256, 128, 64, 64, and 64.
The final layer is a softmax layer with the target of predicting the probability
of each event belonging to a particular class.

Each channel of 0-, 1-, and 2-leptons is trained separately,
and has slightly different input variables.
The list of input variables is given in Table~\ref{tab:dnn-inputs}.
All variables that are affected by the kinematic fit in the 2-lepton region
use the values calculated by the fit.

\begin{table}

  \end{tabularx}
  \label{tab:dnn-inputs}
\end{table}

\subsection{Boosted BDT}

The BDT used to classify signal and background events in the boosted region
was trained using ROOT.
The model uses 100 trees with 20 cuts and a minimum node size of 0.05.
The QCD multi-jet backgrounds were not used in the training since the sample's large weights
of individual events affected the training.

The list of input variables for the BDT is the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Soft-drop mass of the reconstructed fat jet
\item Transverse momentum of the fat jet
\item Transverse momentum of the reconstructed vector boson
\item Number of soft-track jets with $p_T > \SI{5}{GeV}$
\item Double $b$-tagger output node for boosted jets
\end{itemize}
All of these variables were used in the 0-, 1-, and 2-lepton regions,
even though the regions were trained separately.

\section{Combination Fit}

A simultaneous fit is run over all channels, control regions, and the signal selection region
in order to determine the most likely values for all
parameters with systematic uncertainties, called nuisance parameters,
as well as the most likely scale factors for all the MC backgrounds and signal.
The fit is done by using the \texttt{combine} tool \cite{cmsdocumentation} as part of
\texttt{CMSSW\_10\_2\_13} \cite{cmssw_doxygen}.
Part of the method for discovery involves finding the most likely values
for all nuisance parameters and signal strength simultaneously.
This maximum likelihood feature is used for the measurement of signal strength in
the STXS bins.
The difference in signal strength uncertainty when allowing the nuisance parameters to float
from their most likely values or not show the overall effect of the systematic uncertainties
on the final measurement.

In addition, \texttt{combine} includes a variety of diagnostic tools to ensure
the assumed model is adequate.
The first step before unblinding results is to throw toys using the best-fit
nuisance parameter values and comparing a test statistic of these toys to that of the observed data.
The distributions of a the values from the set of toys allows the evaluation of the $p$-value
of the test statistic observed in data.
The \texttt{combine} tool also evaluates the impacts of each
nuisance parameter on the likelihood by varying them individually.
If nuisance parameters with large impacts are pulled far from their initial value,
that means that an important aspect of the measurement was not well understood.

The final results will therefore show comparison of data and best-fit toys,
called Goodness of Fit, as well as the final scan results.
A post-fit plots will also reveal the way that the fit moves the background and signal distributions
within uncertainties in order for the background to describe the data.
Impacts plots are shown in Appendix~\ref{app:impacts} due to the high multiplicity of nuisance parameters.
Before running these checks and measurements for the $V\!H$ measurement,
they were first tested on $V\!Z$.

\subsection{$V\!Z$ Cross Check Analysis}

The $V\!Z$ cross check analysis mostly duplicated the $V\!H$.
The primary differences are that a di-boson sample with generator-level $b$ hadrons produced
is used as the signal sample, and the signal mass window is moved from $\SI{90}{GeV} < m_{jj} < \SI{150}{GeV}$
to  $\SI{60}{GeV} < m_{jj} < \SI{120}{GeV}$.
However, other differences should be mentioned.
Most of the potential effects of these differences are difficult to quantify,
with the exception of the following.
Additional measured electroweak corrections are applied to the di-boson samples for each STXS bin.
The values of these corrections vary from as low as 4\% for the low $p_T(V)$ bins
and as high as 23\% for the high $p_T(V)$, but all will increase the measured signal strength compared to $V\!H$.
Other differences include the dedicated $V\!Z$ DNN training and
the fact that the $Z$ boson will decay into light flavored jets at a higher proportional rate than the Higgs boson.
The DNN training for $V\!H$ has to account for the similar $V\!Z$ background,
while the $V\!Z$ is not influenced as much by the rare $V\!H$ process.
Also, the light flavor $V\!Z$ process will have more influence over
the control region fits than the $V\!H$ process has.

Data from all three years of Run 2 are used again so that any differences that may affect the $V\!H$ analysis
can also be investigated using $V\!Z$.
The Goodness of Fit plots are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vz-gof}.
The high $p$-value means that the simulated processes were able to match the data very well
while staying within the fit constraints of the systematic uncertainties.

\begin{figure}
  \centering

  \caption[Goodness of Fit for $V\!Z$]{
    The Goodness of Fit test results are shown for $V\!Z$.
    The fit is performed using STXS bins,
    and the test statistic is generated by toys for all control regions and signal regions.
  }
  \label{fig:vz-gof}
\end{figure}

Due to the splitting of STXS bins, the multiple channels for each bin, and the combination of three different years,
486 distributions are fit in the $V\!Z$ cross check analysis.
For the sake of brevity, the effect of the fit will only be shown on eight of these distributions for the $V\!Z$
cross-check analysis.
These are split into two figures, each showing distributions closely related to each other.
On the left of each figure are simulation values and uncertainties
before the nuisance parameters are fit to match the simulation to data.
On the right are the simulated values after fitting the nuisance parameters.
In the lower parts of each plot, ratios between observed data and expected yields improve as a result of the fit.
The uncertainties of the simulations also decrease as a result of the fit.
Some nuisance parameters end up with smaller individual uncertainties from the fit,
including the initially large migration uncertainties.
Figure~\ref{fig:impact-ex} shows this decrease in bin migration uncertainties,
especially in $t\bar{t}$ in line 19.

  }
  \label{fig:impact-ex}
\end{figure}
%
The uncertainty also decreases since each named nuisance parameter is at first
assumed to be uncorrelated to the other nuisance parameters.
The fit reveals many of the nuisance parameters to be correlated, decreasing the overall possible variation.

Figure~\ref{fig:vz-zmm-low-2017} shows all of the distributions fit for the low $p_T$ bin in the
$Z\rightarrow\mu\mu$ channel in 2017.
Several additional features aside from the pre-fit and post-fit differences are worth noting.
There is only one bin in the $t\bar{t}$ control region,
so it is only used to constrain the normalization of the $t\bar{t}$ background.
In the $Z$ + heavy jets control region, the DNN is trained with the same inputs as the signal region DNN.
This constrains the shape uncertainties that would affect both classifiers.
In all of the regions, we can see improved agreement between the simulation and data after the fit, and
the combination fit also decreases the uncertainty on each bin.
The relative contributions of the main background processes can also be seen at a glance at the signal region plots.

These distributions can be compared to those in Figure~\ref{fig:vz-wen-boost-2018},
which shows distributions from the boosted selection of the $W\rightarrow e\nu$ channel in 2018.
In this case, the $W$ + heavy jets control region is not shown because the related process contributes less
in the signal region.
Instead, the $t\bar{t}$ background is dominate in this boosted topology.
The control regions use the double $b$-tag score of the fat jet instead of $p_T(V)$ for the distribution.
The signal region is also split into two higher $p_T(V)$ bins, while the control regions stay combined
to constrain both STXS bins.
As in the low $p_T$ bin, though, both agreement between simulation and data and estimated uncertainties
are improved as a result of the fit.

From these post-fit distributions, the strength and uncertainty of the signal samples are extracted.
A value of 1.0 corresponds to the expectation based on simulation of the Standard Model.
By correlating all of the signal samples across STXS bins,
an inclusive signal strength is obtained.
The likelihood scan of this strength is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vz-inclusive}.
The maximum likelihood with respect to the Standard Model is $1.182^{+0.118}_{-0.112} \mathrm{(stat)}^{+0.098}_{-0.097} \mathrm{(sys)}$.
The uncertainty of this measurement means the result has a $p$-value of 22\%, assuming Standard Model couplings,
or within 1.2 standard deviations of the Standard Model.
Figure~\ref{fig:vz-stxs} shows the measured kinematic distributions of the various $V\!Z$ processes.
Assuming the Standard Model, the measurement has a $p$-value of 23\%.
Overall, the $V\!Z$ cross-check is in agreement with the Standard Model.

\subsection{$V\!H$ Combination Fit Results}

The first step to show that the processes in the detector are well-modeled
by simulation is the Goodness of Fit test.
The Goodness of Fit for the $V\!H$ selection is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vh-gof}.
The observed value for the saturated test statistic is in the bulk of the distribution created by throwing
post-fit toys, with an associated $p$-value of 70\%, suggesting both good modeling and
reasonable values for post-fit uncertainties.

    The Goodness of Fit test results are shown for $V\!H$.
    The fit is performed using STXS bins,
    and the test statistic is generated by toys for all control regions and signal regions.
  }
  \label{fig:vh-gof}
\end{figure}

A selection of post-fit distributions are also shown.
Like, the $V\!Z$ analysis, there are too many distributions to show all of them in this work,
so what follows are only a few illustrative examples.
Figure~\ref{fig:vh-znn-high-2016} shows the zero-lepton channel in the high $p_T(V)$ regime.
Unlike the two lepton selections shown,
the signal distributions display contamination from $W$ + jets background processes.
There is no zero-lepton control region for $W$ + jets.
Instead, these backgrounds are controlled only by one-lepton control regions,
so the five channels are correlated in the fit.

The signal strength extracted from the fit can be separated a number of ways.
The inclusive signal strength is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vh-inclusive} to be $0.568^{+0.154}_{-0.147} \mathrm{(stat)}^{+0.134}_{-0.133} \mathrm{(sys)}$.
The uncertainties put this measurement within 2.1 standard deviations of the Standard Model.
Figure~\ref{fig:vh-whzh} shows that this low value is caused by a low cross section measurement of $Z\!H$,
which alone is 2.9 standard deviations below the Standard Model.
Figure~\ref{fig:vh-stxs} shows the full STXS measurement results.
Both $Z\!H$ and $W\!H$ show increasing trends in differential cross section as $p_T(V)$ increases.
However, substituting the inclusive signal strength in for the Standard Model,
the STXS scans have an agreement with a $p$-value of 9.3\%.
Standard Model kinematics cannot be entirely ruled out by this measure.

The total coupling between the Higgs boson and vector bosons, as well as the coupling between
the Higgs boson and bottom quarks is measured using the kappa framework \cite{de_Blas_2020}.
Results of this analysis alone are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kappa}.
Standard Model values of $\kappa_V = \kappa_b = 1$ fall within the 68\% confidence level.
The results of this $\kappa$ scan can be additionally constrained by combining
this analysis with others that focus on using either vector bosons for Higgs production
or the $b\bar{b}$ decay path.
