\chapter{Theory} \label{ch:theory}

Before diving into the description of the experimental apparatus,
an explanation of why it is expected to work is needed.
As described in Chapter~\ref{ch:intro}, a model is used to describe reality.
The Standard Model Lagrangian can be defined as a sum of Lagrangians that each describe
the interactions between different fermions and bosons.
Equations of motion can be extracted from a Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$ for a particle field $\phi_i$
using the Euler-Lagrange equations.
