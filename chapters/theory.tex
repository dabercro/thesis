\chapter{Theory} \label{ch:theory}

Before diving into the description of the experimental apparatus,
an explanation of why it is expected to work is needed.
As described in Chapter~\ref{ch:intro}, a model is used to describe reality.
The Standard Model Lagrangian can be defined as a sum of Lagrangians that each describe
the interactions between different fermions and bosons.
Equations of motion can be extracted from a Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$
for a particle field $\phi_i$ using the Euler-Lagrange equations.

\begin{gather}
  \delta_\mu\left(\frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta(\delta_\mu \phi_i)}\right) -
  \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta \phi_i} = 0
\end{gather}

In the measurement of $H\rightarrow \bb$ in associated production,
many components of the Standard Model are of interest.
These will be introduced as needed.
First, I will give a brief explanation of Higgs field's non-zero vacuum energy,
a trait that makes the Higgs one of the central keystones to Standard Model.
After that, the electro-weak Lagragian will be described since
the cross section of associated production depends on
the coupling of the Higgs Boson to the $W$ and $Z$ vector bosons.
The coupling of the electro-weak force to fermions is also important to
understand both the generation of these intermediate states and
the resulting final state that the CMS detector records.
Another important factor for this work is a the decay of the Higgs boson itself into bottom quarks.
This depends on the Higgs directly coupling to fermions.
Finally, we will briefly consider the part of the Lagrangian describing the strong force.
Since the LHC is a hadron collider,
understanding of the strong force is required to extract data from LHC collisions.

\section{The Higgs Mechanism}

In both of these components of the Standard Model Lagrangian,
the Higgs coupling actually gives the vector bosons and fermions their mass.
