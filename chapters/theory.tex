\chapter{Theory} \label{ch:theory}

Before diving into the description of the experimental apparatus,
an explanation of why it is expected to work is needed.
There are many textbooks that cover the Standard Model, as there are many students who study it.
Much of what follows is taken from the book by Mark Thompson \cite{Thomson:1529540}.

The Standard Model Lagrangian can be defined as a sum of Lagrangians that each describe
the interactions between different fermions and bosons.
Equations of motion can be extracted from a Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$
for a particle field $\phi_i$ using the Euler-Lagrange equations.

\begin{gather}
  \delta_\mu\left(\frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta(\delta_\mu \phi_i)}\right) -
  \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta \phi_i} = 0
\end{gather}

In the measurement of $H\rightarrow \bb$ in associated production,
many components of the Standard Model are of interest.
These will be introduced as needed.
First, I will give a brief explanation of Higgs field's non-zero vacuum energy,
a trait that makes the Higgs one of the central keystones to Standard Model.
After that, the electroweak Lagrangian will be described since
the cross section of associated production depends on
the coupling of the Higgs Boson to the $W$ and $Z$ vector bosons.
The coupling of the electroweak force to fermions is also important to
understand both the generation of these intermediate states and
the resulting final state that the CMS detector records.
Another important factor for this work is a the decay of the Higgs boson itself into bottom quarks.
This depends on the Higgs directly coupling to fermions.
Finally, we will briefly consider the part of the Lagrangian describing the strong force.
Since the LHC is a hadron collider,
understanding of the strong force is required to extract data from LHC collisions.

\section{The Higgs Mechanism}

In both of these components of the Standard Model Lagrangian,
the Higgs coupling actually gives the vector bosons and massive fermions their mass.
(In this work, neutrinos can be treated as massless.)
The granting of mass happens for two reasons:
the Higgs field has a non-zero vacuum expectation value,
and the Higgs field couples to vector boson and massive fermion fields.

The Higgs can be described as two complex scalar fields in a weak isospin doublet
with a quartic potential.
The Lagrangian for a free Higgs is then
\begin{gather}
  \mathcal{L} = (\delta_\mu \phi)^\dagger (\delta^\mu \phi) - (\mu^2(\phi^\dagger\phi) + \lambda(\phi^\dagger\phi)^2) \label{eq:free}
\end{gather}
Through the virial theorem, the potential has a minimum value when
\begin{gather}
  \phi^\dagger\phi = \frac{-\mu^2}{2\lambda} = \frac{v^2}{2} \label{eq:vacuum}
\end{gather}

This potential of the Higgs field breaks the SU(2) $\times$ U(1)
symmetry of the Standard Model Lagrangian.
Through this non-zero vacuum expectation value, the Higgs then has a constant influence
in other parts of the Standard Model Lagrangian.
For this measurement, three interactions that the Higgs makes
with this influence need to be considered:
the Higgs interacting with itself,
the Higgs interacting with the electroweak vector bosons,
and the Higgs interacting with quarks.

The first two interactions manifest in the Lagrangian when
we force the SU(2) $\times$ U(1) symmetry on the Lagrangian in Equation~\ref{eq:free}.
The derivatives must be replaced.
\begin{gather}
  \delta_\mu \rightarrow D_\mu = \delta_\mu + i\frac{g_W}{2} {\boldsymbol \sigma} \cdot {\bf W_\mu} + ig'\frac{Y}{2}B_\mu
\end{gather}
$\phi$ can be rewritten to satisfy the vacuum expectation value in the gauge that will give us the massless neutral boson known as a photon.
\begin{gather}
  \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
    0 \\
    v + h(x)
  \end{matrix}
  \right)
\end{gather}
This leads to the following expansion for the kinetic term of the Lagrangian.
\begin{align}
  (D_\mu \phi)^\dagger(D^\mu \phi) = & \frac12 (\delta_\mu h)(\delta^\mu h)
  + \frac18 g_W^2 (W^{(1)}_\mu + iW^{(2)}_\mu)(W^{(1)\mu} - iW^{(2)\mu})(v + h)^2 \nonumber \\
  & + \frac18 (g_W W^{(3)}_\mu - g'B_\mu)(g_W W^{((3)\mu} - g' B^\mu)(v + h)^2
\end{align}

Terms that are quadratic in terms of the gauge boson fields reveal the mass of the fields.
Taking $h(x) \rightarrow 0$, the terms for $W^{(1)}$ and $W^{(2)}$ are the just
\[
\frac14 g_W^2 v^2 W^{(1)}_\mu W^{(1)\mu} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad
\frac14 g_W^2 v^2 W^{(2)}_\mu W^{(2)\mu},
\]
giving the mass.
\begin{gather}
  m_W = \frac12 g_W v
\end{gather}
The quadratic terms for $W^{(3)}$ and $B$ mix to give a non-diagonal mass matrix ${\bf M}$.
\begin{gather}
  \frac{v^2}{8}
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
  W^{(3)}_\mu & B_\mu
  \end{matrix}
  \right) {\bf M} \left(
  \begin{matrix}
  W^{(3)\mu} \\ B^\mu
  \end{matrix}
  \right) = 
  \frac{v^2}{8}
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
  W^{(3)}_\mu & B_\mu
  \end{matrix}
  \right)
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
    g_W^2 & -g_W g' \\
    -g_W g' & g'^2
  \end{matrix}
  \right)
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
  W^{(3)\mu} \\ B^\mu
  \end{matrix}
  \right)
\end{gather}
The non-diagonal matrix allow $W^{(3)}$ and $B$ to mix.
Physical states must be represented by a diagonal Hamiltonian.
Diagonalizing the term above gives masses of the physical states.
\begin{gather}
  \frac18 v^2
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
  A_\mu & Z_\mu
  \end{matrix}
  \right)
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
    0 & 0 \\
    0 & g^2_W + g'^2
  \end{matrix}
  \right)
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
  A^\mu \\ Z^\mu
  \end{matrix}
  \right) = 
  \frac12
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
  A_\mu & Z_\mu
  \end{matrix}
  \right)
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
    m_A^2 & 0 \\
    0 & m_Z^2
  \end{matrix}
  \right)
  \left(
  \begin{matrix}
  A^\mu \\ Z^\mu
  \end{matrix}
  \right)
\end{gather}
This gives us the masses of the neutral gauge bosons.
\begin{gather}
  m_A = 0 \quad \mathrm{and} \quad m_Z = \frac12 v \sqrt{g^2_W + g'^2}
\end{gather}

From the simple act of requiring SU(2) $\times$ U(1) symmetry on the Lagrangian of a scalar
doublet with non-zero vacuum expectation value,
the masses of all the electroweak gauge bosons have been produced.
The next thing to consider is the couplings also produced by this process.
The couplings will allow us to determine more precisely the parameters above
by measuring cross sections.
